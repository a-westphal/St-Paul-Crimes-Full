			<h2>
			Description of Tools
			</h2>
			<p>
			To create our application we used many different tools. First we created our own API to display data of Crimes from St. Paul.
			We used the Leaflet API in order to display our map of St. Paul. We also used the Nominatim API to convert between addresses and latitude/longitude to display our data.
			We used the framework Bootstrap to layout our page and get the different elements working together. We depended on other tools
			such as jquery, sqlite3, cors, and js2xmlparser in order to get our data and API working.
